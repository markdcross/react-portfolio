              I'm Mark Cross and I'm a full-stack engineer. Born and raised in
              Annapolis, MD, graduate of the University of Delaware (go Blue
              Hens üêì), and now Richmond local. I spent the first decade (and
              change) of my career in SaaS sales and sales leadership, and now
              use the lessons I've learned to build world-class software.
