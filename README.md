# Mark Cross - Welcome to my Portfolio!

This page will be frequently updated as I continue to grow as a developer - check back frequently!

It currently features a clear, clean, and engaging experience with intuitive navigation. It contains a short bio and my tech stack.

The second page is my portfolio, including links to the deployed app and repo of a few of my recent projects.

My résumé is linked (update also pending), and a modal including a contact form and my direct information is available as well.

Thanks for taking a look!
